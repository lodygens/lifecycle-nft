# NFT life cycle

This project demonstrates how to follow the lifecycle of an NFT

NFt lifecycle consists of
1. being created for a user who is the 1st owner
2. potentaly, being passed / sold between users
3. register actions for that NFT
    1. the owner is the only allowed to register actions 
4. goto -2-, if needed
5. potentially destroy the NFT
